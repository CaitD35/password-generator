## password-generator
# Description 
The purpose of this assignmenet was to create a random password generator. The requirement was to modify the starter code provided to generate a random password based on the criteria the user selected. A series of prompts were created to have the user select a length of password and alerted to have user choose if they want to include numbers, lower case, upper case and special characters. Once the user selects from the prompts a random password is then generated to meet that criteria.
